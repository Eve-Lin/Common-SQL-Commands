//SQL Commands

1. SELECT

Syntax: SELECT column1, column2...
FROM table_name

2. SELECT (Distinct/non-duplicate values):

SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2,...
FROM table_name;

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers; //lists the number of distinct customer countries; doesn't work in Edge & Firefox
//For Firefox & Edge
SELECT Count (*) AS DistinctCountries FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);

3. WHERE clause is used to filter records

SELECT column1, column2...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Ex. SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Mexico'; //single quotes (double are also possible)

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = 1; //no quotes with numeric fields

4. SQL AND, OR & NOT

//AND
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND City = 'Berlin';

//OR
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin' OR City = 'Düsseldorf';

//NOT
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Germany';

More examples:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND (City = 'Berlin' OR City = 'Düsseldorf');

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Germany' AND NOT Country = 'Denmark';

5. ORDER BY

Examples:

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country DESC;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName; //first sorts by country and then by customer name

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

6. INSERT INTO

INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, column3,...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...);

//when adding values for all the columns in the table, we don't need to specify the column names in the SQL query

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES(value1, value2, value3,...);

//insert data in specified columns
INSERT INTO Customers(CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES('Cardinl', 'Berlin', 'Germany');
