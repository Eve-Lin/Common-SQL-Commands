//SQL Commands

1. SELECT

FROM table_name

2. SELECT (Distinct/non-duplicate values):

SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2,...
FROM table_name;

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers; //lists the number of distinct customer countries; doesn't work in Edge & Firefox
//For Firefox & Edge
SELECT Count (*) AS DistinctCountries FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);

3. WHERE clause is used to filter records

SELECT column1, column2...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Ex. SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Mexico'; //single quotes (double are also possible)

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = 1; //no quotes with numeric fields

4. SQL AND, OR & NOT

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

6. INSERT INTO

INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, column3,...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...);

//when adding values for all the columns in the table, we don't need to specify the column names in the SQL query
